                    I am a Full Stack Web Developer and content writer with a master’s degree from American University. 
            </p>

            <p class="bio">
                    I am conversant in multiple development languages and tools, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery.  I acquired these skills after attending a six month Coding Bootcamp offered by Rutgers University.  I am excellent at both written and verbal communication and I am trained in cultural sensitivity and conflict resolution.  I’m resourceful, organized, and work effectively both in team environments and independently.
            </p>
                    
            <p class="bio">
                    I enjoy creating user friendly and stylish websites for clients that further important causes.  I am looking to apply my experience and expertise of full stack web development to an established nonprofit or NGO doing crucial humanitarian work to ensure optimal results.
